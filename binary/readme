BOLT version 1.27, compiled intel hex files compatible with the MSP430FR5969 MCU

There are 6 different configurations:
BOLT_64b_noreset.hex
BOLT_64b_reset.hex
BOLT_128b_noreset.hex
BOLT_128b_reset.hex
BOLT_256b_noreset.hex
BOLT_256b_reset.hex

The different variants have different queue element sizes and behaviours after a reset.
64, 128 or 256 bytes are the options for the size of one element in the BOLT queue. Since the amount of FRAM on BOLT is fixed, a larger element size automatically yields a smaller queue size. At 128 bytes per message, there is space for approx. 150 messages in each queue.
The "noreset" in the name means the BOLT queue is not cleared after an MCU reset and therefore retains the data also in case of a power loss.

In addition, there is also a BOLT deepsleep image, which basically just configures the GPIO pins and then enters LPM4. This image is intended to be used on DPP2 DevBoards in case the BOLT functionality is not needed.

To upload the hex image to the MCU, connect an MSP-FET debugger and run "./flash.sh [filename]".
